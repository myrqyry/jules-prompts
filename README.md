    <sub>Useful for Python projects moving towards more structured data handling with `dataclasses` or Pydantic.</sub>

---

## üöÄ Advanced Feature Implementation

* `// Scaffold a complete user authentication system using Passport.js, including local, Google, and GitHub strategies.`
    <sub>For Node.js applications needing robust and flexible user login options.</sub>
* `// Implement a real-time chat feature using WebSockets and Redis for message queuing.`
    <sub>For applications looking to add interactive, real-time communication between users.</sub>
* `// Add a feature-flag system to the application to allow for A/B testing and phased rollouts.`
    <sub>For teams that want to de-risk feature releases and test new ideas with a subset of users.</sub>
* `// Integrate the Stripe API to handle one-time payments and recurring subscriptions.`
    <sub>For applications that need to process payments and manage user subscriptions.</sub>
* `// Build a recommendation engine that suggests content to users based on their viewing history.`
    <sub>For content-heavy platforms aiming to increase user engagement through personalization.</sub>

---

## üé• Content Creator & Streaming

* `// Implement a video upload and processing pipeline that automatically transcodes videos into multiple resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p) using a background worker.`
    <sub>For any video platform that needs to provide a smooth viewing experience on different devices and network conditions.</sub>
* `// Add a real-time chat feature to the live-streaming page using WebSockets, including moderation tools for the streamer.`
    <sub>To increase viewer engagement and build a community around live content.</sub>
* `// Integrate a tipping or "super chat" feature, allowing viewers to send donations to the streamer during a live broadcast, with on-screen alerts.`
    <sub>For creators who want to monetize their live streams through direct fan support.</sub>
* `// Add functionality for creating clips from past live streams, allowing viewers or the creator to share short, highlight-worthy moments.`
    <sub>A great way to make content more shareable and attract new viewers.</sub>

---

## ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Development & Tooling

* `// Set up a new Vite project with Tailwind CSS and a basic Python backend. Create a 'concurrently' script to run both the frontend and backend servers with a single 'npm run dev' command.`
    <sub>For quickly scaffolding new projects with your preferred stack.</sub>
* `// Create a new Zustand store for managing user authentication state. Include actions for logging in, logging out, and fetching the user profile from the Python backend.`
    <sub>A common requirement for most web applications, tailored to your state management library.</sub>
* `// Write a Python proxy endpoint that forwards requests from my Vite frontend to a third-party API, securely handling API keys on the backend.`
    <sub>To avoid exposing sensitive credentials on the client-side and to bypass CORS issues during local development.</sub>
* `// Based on the current state of my project, generate a new feature idea that leverages a large language model. Provide a high-level implementation plan, including the necessary frontend components, Zustand store modifications, and Python backend endpoints.`
    <sub>To spark creativity and give you a roadmap for your next AI-powered feature.</sub>

---

## üé® Project Scaffolding & Content

* `// Generate three distinct theme files (e.g., 'theme-dracula.css', 'theme-solarized.css') that define custom color palettes for my application using CSS variables. Also, create a 'ThemeSwitcher' React component that allows users to toggle between these themes.`
    <sub>For adding theming capabilities to your application, allowing for greater personalization.</sub>
* `// Create a set of preset data for my application. This should be a JSON file containing at least five different configurations that a user can load to see various examples of what the app can do. Also, update my Zustand store to include a 'loadPreset' action.`
    <sub>Perfect for applications that have a lot of configuration options, giving users a starting point to explore from.</sub>
* `// Scaffold a new example page in my Vite application. The page should demonstrate a key feature and be pre-populated with realistic-looking data. Include a new route for this page and add it to the main navigation.`
    <sub>To showcase the capabilities of your application and provide clear, working examples for your users.</sub>
* `// Create a "template gallery" feature. This should include a set of pre-designed templates (as JSON or another format) that users can select to initialize a new project or document within my application. Update the UI to include a modal for selecting a template.`
    <sub>A powerful feature for any application that involves creation, from documents to dashboards to designs.</sub>

---

## üßπ Codebase Refactoring & Maintenance

* `// Analyze the entire codebase and identify the top 5 largest files (in terms of lines of code). For each file, provide a brief summary of its responsibilities and suggest a strategy for splitting it into smaller, more focused modules.`
    <sub>A great starting point for any refactoring effort. It gives you a high-level overview of where the "hotspots" are in your codebase.</sub>
* `// I have a large file called 'utils.js' that has become a dumping ground for miscellaneous functions. Analyze this file, group related functions together, and refactor them into separate, more specific utility files (e.g., 'date-utils.js', 'api-utils.js', 'string-utils.js').`
    <sub>A common problem in many projects! This prompt helps you tackle the "junk drawer" file and organize it into a more logical structure.</sub>
* `// This React component has grown too large and is handling too many responsibilities. Analyze the component, identify distinct pieces of functionality (e.g., state management, data fetching, rendering logic), and refactor it into a container component with several smaller, presentational child components.`
    <sub>For frontend development, this is a classic pattern for improving component architecture and reusability.</sub>
* `// This Zustand store is managing state for multiple, unrelated features. Analyze the store, identify the different state "slices," and refactor it into multiple, feature-specific stores. Then, demonstrate how to use them together in a component.`
    <sub>As your application grows, so does your state. This prompt helps you keep your state management clean and organized.</sub>

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è DevOps & Infrastructure

* `// Write a Dockerfile for my Node.js/Python/Go application and a docker-compose.yml file to run it with a database.`

* `// Create a complete GitHub Actions workflow to build, test, and deploy my application to a cloud provider like Vercel or AWS.`
  <sub>For setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline.</sub>
* `// Write a Terraform script to provision the necessary infrastructure for this project on AWS/GCP/Azure.`
